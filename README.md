# Window Switcher
This is a Window Switcher.
It shows buttons for all apps currently running.
As you click on one of the button, the window on your screen will switch to that app.
If you press your mouse on any button area and drag, the Switcher will be dragged.
It is half transparent. As your mouse hover over it, it turns opaque.
More under developed.
